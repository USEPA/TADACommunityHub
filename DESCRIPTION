Description: This package will serve as a repository for holding state, tribal, 
    and territorial criteria and methods that have been filled out and reviewed
    by the appropriate subject matter expert for clean water act assessments. 
    Future functionality will assist with handling accidental overwrites, 
    submitting additional rows for parameters and uses of waters that have new 
    criteria and methods developed, replacing existing parameter and use combinations
    with updated criteria and method and validating data type submissions and 
    conversions if needed (for example, empty columns may be read as a different 
    data type and may need to be converted to a string or integer as necessary).
